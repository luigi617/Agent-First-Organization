ASSISTANT: Hello! I\'m your Stack Overflow Developer Assistant. How can I assist you with your coding challenges today?\nUSER: give me a list of unanswered question related to python and c++\nASSISTANT: I\'m unable to browse the web in real-time, so I can\'t provide a current list of unanswered questions. However, I can guide you on how to find these questions on Stack Overflow.\n\n1. **Visit Stack Overflow**: Go to [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com).\n\n2. **Use the Search Bar**: Enter "python" or "C++" in the search bar.\n\n3. **Filter by Unanswered Questions**: Once you get the search results, you can filter them to show only unanswered questions by clicking on the "Unanswered" tab.\n\n4. **Sort by Tags**: You can further filter the results using tags like `[python]` or `[c++]` to see specific questions related to these languages.\n\nBy following these steps, you can find unanswered questions that you may be able to contribute answers to. Happy coding!\nUSER: what about if I want to get questions related to javascript
